# LQCDNN

So far, this is basic code to generate gauge configurations for the 2D lattice Schwinger model in Python. I am hoping to extend the capabilities to include a multigrid inverter, and then test some ideas for Deep Neural Networks. Also going to use pycuda to accelerate the mat-vec operations!
